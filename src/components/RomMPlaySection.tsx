  // Content-dir warning (#239) — prominent banner above the play row when
  // RetroArch writes saves to the content directory. The play row still renders
  // below it: the game remains fully playable, only save sync is unavailable.
  // The store holds the flag whether or not save sync is on (it is a fact about
  // the local RetroArch config, not about our setting); the banner asks the user
  // to change that config to re-enable save sync, so it is only worth showing to
  // someone who has save sync on.
  //
  // The banner is a keyed sibling under a Fragment, never a branch returning a
  // different root: the flag lands a moment after the row first paints, and a
  // root whose element type changes makes React unmount the whole row — the play
  // button drops back to "loading" and re-runs its init (#1682). A Fragment adds
  // no DOM node, so the row stays a direct child of the injected panel either way.
