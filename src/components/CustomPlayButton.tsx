/**
 * Custom Play button that replaces the native Steam Play button on RomM game
 * detail pages. Handles 3 primary states:
 * - Download: ROM not installed, click to download
 * - Play: ROM installed, launches the game (with pre-launch save sync)
 * - Syncing: Save sync in progress before launch
 *
 * Includes a dropdown menu button (arrow) to the right of the Play button
 * with action: Uninstall.
