<h3>Your emulator library, running in Steam</h3>

This fork adds [EmuParadise catalogue imports with Romspedia/RomsDL downloads](docs/user-guide/catalogue-imports.md)
and configured EmuDeck launch support alongside RetroDECK. RomM remains supported.
See the linked guide for the current installation and download limits.

</div>

A [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) plugin that syncs your self-hosted [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) library
into Steam as non-steam shortcuts. Games appear directly in your Steam library, launch through
[RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/), and can keep their saves in sync across devices through your RomM server.

_Named after the railway car behind a steam locomotive, or the boat that shuttles out to a ship at anchor._

> **Pre-1.0 (v0.x).** The feature set isn't complete yet. Save sync covers standard cartridge saves; the memory-card
> systems — PlayStation, PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube, PSP, 3DS — don't sync their saves yet, and the
> [support matrix](https://danielcopper.github.io/romm-tender/user-guide/save-sync-support-matrix/) has the per-system
> detail.

---

> [!NOTE]
> **How this is built.** The code is written by an AI coding agent working under my direction. The architecture, the
> design decisions and the review are mine, and changes are smoke-tested on real hardware before they ship.

## Features

- **Library sync** — Pulls the platforms and collections you pick from your RomM server into Steam as non-steam
  shortcuts with RomM cover art; later runs are incremental and preview what will change before touching anything
- **SteamGridDB artwork** — Add a free [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) key to get hero banners, logos, wide
  capsules and custom icons, with a manual picker for games that don't match automatically
- **Save sync** — Opt-in save syncing across devices through your RomM server, automatically before launch and after you
  quit; identical saves resolve silently, and if both sides genuinely changed you decide which one wins
  ([not every system syncs yet](https://danielcopper.github.io/romm-tender/user-guide/save-sync-support-matrix/))
- **Save slots & version history** — Multiple named save profiles per game, plus per-file version history with restore
- **ROM downloads** — Download on demand with progress, pause/resume/cancel, and a managed queue
- **BIOS management** — Per-platform BIOS status, download all or only what your active core requires, hash-verified
  against a bundled registry, and delete them again when you're done
- **Game detail page** — Replaces Steam's page for synced games: RomM metadata, RetroAchievements progress, playtime,
  install and BIOS status, save management, and per-game actions
- **Multi-disc & multi-version** — Pick the disc for multi-disc games and switch between regions or revisions of the
  same game, right from its Steam page
- **Emulator cores** — Set the core per system, or override it for a single game
- **Steam Input** — Pick a Steam Input mode (Default / Force On / Force Off) and apply it to every shortcut the plugin
  created
- **RetroArch input fix** — Spots the `input_driver` value that breaks controller navigation in RetroArch's menus and
  repairs it in one tap
- **Follows RetroDECK moves** — Moved RetroDECK to another drive? The ROMs, BIOS files and saves the plugin manages are
  relocated and your shortcuts repointed — nothing needs re-downloading
- **Cleanup tools** — Remove shortcuts per platform or all at once, uninstall ROMs, and clear orphaned grid images

## Requirements

- [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) on your Steam Deck or Linux HTPC — the plugin lives in Steam's gamepad UI, so it
  works in the Deck's Game Mode **or** in Big Picture Mode on any Linux PC
- A running [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) server, **version 4.9.0 or newer** (the plugin stays inert against
  older servers)
- [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/) for launching games

## Installation

**Not on the Decky store.** The store doesn't accept plugins whose code is written with AI assistance, and Tender's is —
see _How this is built_ above. Install it from the URL below.

```text
https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-tender/releases/latest/download/Tender.zip
```

<details open>
<summary><b>Install from URL</b> — the recommended way</summary>

Needs **Developer mode** in Decky Loader (Decky tab → gear icon → **General → Other** → toggle **Developer mode**).

1. Decky settings → **Developer** tab → **Install Plugin from URL**
2. Paste the URL above and install

That URL always resolves to the newest release, so pasting it again is also how you update.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install from ZIP</b></summary>

Also needs **Developer mode**.

1. Download the plugin's `.zip` asset from the [releases page](https://github.com/danielcopper/romm-tender/releases)
2. Decky settings → **Developer** tab → **Install Plugin from ZIP File**

</details>

> Full step-by-step instructions, including first-time setup, are in
> [Getting Started](https://danielcopper.github.io/romm-tender/user-guide/getting-started/).

## Quick start

1. Open the Quick Access Menu and select **Tender**
2. In **Settings**, enter your RomM server URL and credentials, then hit **Test Connection**
3. In **Platforms**, enable the platforms you want to sync
4. Open **Sync** and hit **Sync Library** — look over the changes it works out, then **Apply Sync**, and your ROMs
   appear as non-steam shortcuts

See the [User Guide](https://danielcopper.github.io/romm-tender/user-guide/syncing-your-library/) for syncing details,
[save sync](https://danielcopper.github.io/romm-tender/user-guide/save-sync/), and
[BIOS management](https://danielcopper.github.io/romm-tender/user-guide/bios-management/).

## Acknowledgments

This plugin stands on the shoulders of some great projects:

- [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) — the self-hosted ROM manager at the heart of this plugin. RomM provides the
  library, metadata, cover art, and save file storage that makes the entire sync experience possible
- [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net/) — the all-in-one emulation solution for Steam Deck that bundles ES-DE, RetroArch,
  and standalone emulators into a single flatpak. Our entire launch chain runs through RetroDECK
- [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz/) — the plugin framework that makes all of this possible
- [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/) — for the Steam Deck, SteamOS, and an open enough platform to build on
- [Unifideck](https://github.com/ma3ke/unifideck) — inspiration for game detail page injection techniques and gamepad
  navigation patterns
- [MetaDeck](https://github.com/EmuDeck/MetaDeck) — inspiration for store patching patterns used in metadata display on
  non-Steam shortcuts
- [Argosy](https://github.com/rommapp/argosy-launcher) — RomM's Android device-sync client. Its baseline-anchored
  save-conflict handling — client-side detection layered over RomM's negotiate transport, with a keep-local/keep-remote
  prompt on genuine divergence — validated the posture this plugin's save sync takes
- [Grout](https://github.com/rommapp/grout) — RomM's Linux handheld client. Its 409-driven upload reconciliation (POST
  with overwrite=false, downgrading to a download when the local save is unchanged and surfacing a conflict when it
  diverged) informed this plugin's negotiate upload and conflict path
