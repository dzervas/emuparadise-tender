"""Adapter half of the composition root — the only place adapters are constructed.

Adapter construction lives here so ``main.py`` only deals with the
Decky lifecycle and the callable surface. ``bootstrap()`` also loads
and migrates settings as part of adapter wiring so adapters that bind
a live mutable settings dict (such as ``RommHttpAdapter``) bind the
migrated dict in a single pass; that same dict is returned for the
caller to keep as its source of truth.

The bundles defined here are the typed vocabulary the service half
consumes; nothing outside this module instantiates an adapter.
