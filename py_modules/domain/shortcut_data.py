    """What a ROM launches with — a libretro core, a standalone emulator, or a direct sandbox launch.

    The plugin resolves one of these per ROM and bakes it into the shortcut's
    ``launch_options`` via :func:`resolve_emulator_invocation`. The payload
    carried depends on ``kind``:

    - ``kind == "libretro"`` → ``core_so`` is the BARE core name (no ``.so``); the
      renderer emits the RetroArch ``-L <coresdir>/<so>.so %ROM%`` form (the cores
      dir is baked literally because RetroDECK does not expand ``%CORE_RETROARCH%``
      through ``-e``).
    - ``kind == "standalone"`` → ``command`` is the full ES-DE ``<command>`` text
      (already ending in ``%ROM%``, e.g. ``%EMULATOR_RPCS3% --no-gui %ROM%``),
      baked verbatim into ``-e``. RetroDECK's ``run_game.sh`` resolves
      ``%EMULATOR_*%`` and substitutes ``%ROM%`` with the trailing rom path.
    - ``kind == "direct"`` → the folder-boot form (ADR-0019): ``command`` is the
      same full ES-DE standalone command AND ``launcher`` is the emulator's
      sandbox launcher path (e.g.
      ``/app/retrodeck/components/rpcs3/component_launcher.sh``). The renderer
      emits ``flatpak run --command=<launcher> <app> <args>`` — running the
      emulator launcher directly INSIDE the sandbox, bypassing ``run_game.sh``,
      because ``run_game.sh`` reinterprets any directory ``%ROM%`` as an ES-DE
      "directory as a file" and can never launch a bare game folder. The ``<args>``
      are the standalone command's middle (``%EMULATOR_*%`` and ``%ROM%``
      stripped, e.g. ``--no-gui``); the game folder is appended by
      :func:`build_launch_options`.

    ``label`` is the ES-DE display label (diagnostics only). This is the
    standalone-emulator seam (#129); read-path consumers that only understand
    libretro keep reading ``core_so`` (``None`` for a standalone or direct
    emulator) and degrade exactly as they do for a ``(None, None)`` resolution.

    the shortcut holds ``""`` either way. Only the data layer separates them —
    no ``rom_installs`` row versus a row with ``launchable = 0``. Never read

    Empty is the established uninstalled state, not a new one invented here:

    ``applied_launch_options`` (``services/rom_removal.py``).

    The path is double-quoted so paths with spaces survive the launcher's
    ``exec "$@"``. Embedded ``\\`` and ``"`` in the path are backslash-escaped
    (backslash first, then quote) so a server-controlled ROM filename cannot
    break out of the quoted token and inject extra argv elements into the

    build-time text whose own ``-e "..."`` quoting must survive verbatim.
