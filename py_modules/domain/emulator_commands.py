"""Classify ES-DE ``<command>`` strings into safely-bakeable emulator options.

Given the label + command text of one ES-DE ``<command>``, decide whether the
plugin can bake it into a Steam shortcut's ``-e`` override — a real emulator
invocation ending in ``%ROM%`` — and whether it is a RetroArch libretro core or
a standalone emulator. The system-layer default is the first *safely-bakeable*
command in document order; the emulator picker offers every command annotated
with its bakeability and, when it cannot be baked, the reason.

Pure compute only — takes the ``(label, text)`` pairs of one catalogue entry,
which :mod:`adapters.atlas_catalogue` reads off ``es_systems.xml``, and returns
value objects. The launch-bake itself (``EmulatorInvocation`` → the ``-e``
string) lives in :mod:`domain.shortcut_data`; this module only decides *which*
command becomes that invocation.

    - ``"bakeable"`` — a real emulator invocation ending in ``%ROM%`` the plugin
      can bake into a shortcut ``-e`` override (``reason`` is ``None``).
    - ``"needs_setup"`` — a command that is well-formed but not yet launchable

      installed in RetroDECK (reason ``"not_installed"``, applied post-hoc by
      :func:`downgrade_if_not_installed` from the adapter's on-disk probe).
