"""PlaytimeService — playtime tracking via RomM's native play-session ingest.

Owns per-ROM play sessions: opening a session, folding its duration into the
``Playtime`` aggregate on close, holding closed sessions in a durable outbox,
flushing them to RomM's native ``/api/play-sessions`` (best-effort, offline-safe),
and reconciling the local cumulative total against the cross-device server union
(ADR-0018). It also owns the durable "re-sign-in to enable cross-device playtime"
notice: a reconcile GET that 403s (the token predates the ``roms.user.read``
scope) raises the flag; a later successful GET, or a fresh sign-in, clears it.
All durable state lives in the ``rom_playtime`` / ``rom_playtime_sessions`` tables
and the ``kv_config`` scalar surface behind the Unit of Work; all RomM
communication goes through ``RommPlaytimeApi``. No ``import decky``.

        block every valid session queued behind it (#1312). The 422 body names

        (the byte-identical entry draws the same verdict forever, exactly like a
