"""What the plugin already knows about the library, read back out of the local database.

The sync run needs two kinds of knowledge before it can decide anything: what
RomM currently holds, and what this device recorded last time. The first is
:class:`~services.library.fetcher.LibraryFetcher`'s — it reads outward, over
HTTP. This module is its inward pair: every method here reads the plugin's own
SQLite, and nothing here talks to RomM. That split is the reason the two exist
separately, so a method that would have to ask the server does not belong here
however well it fits the sentence below.

What the local side knows is the ``Rom`` rows this device bound to Steam
shortcuts, the per-platform completion stamps its runs left behind, the sibling
group keys it persisted, and the last run that finished — shaped here into the
projections a run's decisions are made against. The decisions themselves live in
``domain/`` and the moves in
:class:`~services.library.sync_orchestrator.SyncOrchestrator`; the reads are all
this module does. It has no phase of its own — the baseline reads open a
preview, the stale scan closes a run — so being local, not being early, is what
holds it together.

**The module is declared read-only**, and that is checked:
``scripts/check_read_only_module.py`` fails on any repository call here that is
not a read. Its reach stops at what this file itself calls, and at calls rather
than bound-method references, and it reads a method's *name* rather than what it
does — so a write named like a read (``get_or_create``) would pass. The
declaration is worth having anyway: every method here opens its own short Unit
of Work and is offloaded through the orchestrator's executor at points chosen
for cheapness, so a write among them would land at a moment nobody picked.

Two neighbours belong to the orchestrator instead, deliberately, though both
touch the same tables through the same repositories:

* ``_clear_platform_stamp_io`` **writes**. That alone rules it out of a
  read-only module, and it belongs with the apply pipeline that performs it
  rather than with the projections a run reasons about.
  :meth:`LocalLibraryReader.do_count_unstamped_platforms` reads the same table and
  answers a question the caller weighs; the delete is a step the pipeline takes.
  *When* it is taken — after the fetch, after the artwork, after the cancel
  guard, before the first chunk, so a crash in between leaves no stamp
  (ADR-0023 / #1025) — is a property of its call site, and the argument for that
  ordering lives there in full.
* ``_stamp_component_group_keys`` does no I/O at all — it calls a pure domain
  function and writes the result back onto the caller's own list.

The projections' *shapes* are a contract with :mod:`domain.sync_diff`: an entry
here is what ``classify_roms`` / ``collapse_sibling_groups`` read, and
``services/artwork.py``'s invalidation pass scans the same dicts for
``cover_source``. Changing a key is changing that contract, not this file.
