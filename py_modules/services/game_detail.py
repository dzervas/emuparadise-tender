"""GameDetailService — game detail page data aggregation.

Aggregates the synced-ROM registry, install record, cached save-sync state,
firmware cache, cached ROM metadata, and achievement progress into a single
response payload for the frontend game detail page. Reads the relational state
from SQLite through the Unit of Work; the platform display name comes from the
offline ``kv_config`` cache (not stored on the ROM — see ADR-0003). Cross-service
reads (BIOS, achievements) go through callback-injected Protocols so the service
stays independent of other service modules.
