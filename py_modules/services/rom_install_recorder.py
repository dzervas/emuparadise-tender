"""RomInstallRecorder — the one writer of an install record and its shortcut bake.

Owns everything between "the ROM's files are in place" and "Steam can launch
them": the launchable verdict, the ``rom_installs`` upsert, the launch command
resolved from the ROM's persisted core and disc pick, and the applied-state memo
the next sync's delta apply reads back.

Both routes to an installed ROM go through here — a completed download and an
adoption of content the plugin did not download — so the row and the launch
command an adoption produces are derived by exactly the rules a download's are
(ADR-0028), not by a second implementation free to drift.

Every method is synchronous and opens its own short write Unit of Work
(ADR-0006); callers on the event loop offload via ``loop.run_in_executor``.
