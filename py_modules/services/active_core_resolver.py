"""ActiveCoreResolver — the single read-path core-resolution seam per ROM.

The one place that answers "which RetroArch core will this ROM actually launch
with?", combining the per-game ``emulator_override`` and per-platform core
selection (the two deviations the plugin owns) with the system-layer
ES-DE/RetroDECK resolution. Every per-game core read consumer and every
launch-bake site draws from this seam so the read-path core never diverges from
the launched core.

Precedence (three layers, then the plain launch): DB ``emulator_override`` (top)
→ ``settings.json`` per-platform core → the live es_systems default → ``None``.
An ES-DE ``<alternativeEmulator>`` or ``<altemulator>`` never moves that default
— the promotion is discarded where the catalogue is read (ADR-0012) — and there
is no offline snapshot below the live default. A pinned per-game or
per-platform label that no longer resolves to a bakeable emulator degrades to
the next layer rather than raising — so a stale label never blocks a read or
bakes a bogus ``-e`` override. The per-game/per-platform label may name a
**standalone** emulator (not just a libretro core); it resolves the same way.

        The launch-bake seam. Reads the ROM's ``platform_slug`` +
        ``emulator_override`` once, then applies the three-layer precedence:

        1. Per-game DB ``emulator_override`` (an emulator LABEL from the picker,
           libretro OR standalone) → its invocation when the label resolves to a
           bakeable command.
        2. Per-platform ``settings.json`` core (also a LABEL, libretro OR
           standalone) → its invocation when it resolves.
        3. The live es_systems default via ``get_default_emulator`` — the first
           safely-bakeable command, which may itself be standalone (PCSX2, RPCS3,
           Dolphin, …) or libretro.

        Returns ``None`` when the platform has no resolvable emulator at all —
        including when ``es_systems.xml`` cannot be read — so the caller bakes
        the plain launch and lets RetroDECK resolve the emulator. A stale
        per-game/per-platform label is never fatal — it degrades to the next
        layer with a WARNING.

        Final step: a resolved **standalone** emulator whose install is a
        folder-boot layout (PS3 — ``…/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN``) is rewritten
        to the ``direct`` sandbox form (ADR-0019). RetroDECK's ``run_game.sh``
        reinterprets a directory ``%ROM%`` as an ES-DE "directory as a file" and
        can never launch a bare game folder, so a folder-boot game must run its
        emulator launcher directly inside the sandbox instead. The rewrite keys
        off :func:`folder_boot_root` — the same fact the disc/bake-path seam uses
        to fold the target to the game folder — so the invocation form and the
        baked path are always decided from one layout fact. A libretro emulator,
        a non-folder install, or an unresolvable sandbox launcher all leave the
        invocation unchanged.
