"""LaunchGateService — single-callable launch-time gating verdict.

Composes the three pieces of information the frontend's pre-launch
interceptor needs into one round-trip: is this Steam app a RomM ROM,
is that ROM installed, and does it have an unresolved save conflict.
Returns a typed ``LaunchVerdict`` carrying the allow/block decision
plus optional reason and toast strings. Per-service migration-store
checks and the fire-and-forget migration refresh stay on the frontend
because they touch synchronous in-memory state and intentionally do
not block the launch.
