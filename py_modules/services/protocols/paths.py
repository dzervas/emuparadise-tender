"""RetroDECK runtime path, system, and core resolution Protocols.

Services query the host RetroDECK/RetroArch/ES-DE environment through
these Protocols: filesystem path getters (saves, roms, BIOS,
RetroDECK home), platform-to-system resolution, the RetroArch save-file
layout, and RetroArch core lookups for ES-DE configured systems.
``PlatformCoreReader`` exposes the plugin-owned per-platform core
selection (stored in ``settings.json``, not the ES-DE gamelist) that the
resolver layers over the es_systems default.
