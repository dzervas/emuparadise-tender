# Vendored copies

What this directory holds is **upstream code we do not own** — verbatim, or verbatim plus a documented local patch,
pinned by the provenance below, excluded from our own linters and gates, and redistributed in the release zip, so each
copy keeps its upstream licence (inside the package directory, or beside it as `<package>.LICENSE` where the copy is
pinned against upstream's own file manifest). That, and not any one import mechanism, is what puts something here;
keeping the copies under one root is what lets a single set of exclusions cover them all. See the `_vendor/` rules in
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

Everything here today is a third-party runtime dependency, vendored because Decky Loader has no plugin-level package
manager and imported as `from _vendor import <package>` — and only adapters import `_vendor.*`. The provenance entries
below make updating any of them a deliberate diff rather than "diff and pray".

## Manifests

Every package directory here is pinned by a `<package>.SHA256SUMS` beside it, in the format `sha256sum` writes
(`<digest>  <path>`, paths relative to this directory). `scripts/check_vendored_trees.py` discovers those manifests
rather than being told about them: per tree it asserts that every `<package>/` digest matches and that the vendored file
set **equals** the manifest's entries under that prefix, and it **fails on a package directory that has no manifest at
all** — so vendoring a package and forgetting its manifest breaks the build instead of quietly leaving one tree
unguarded beside a guarded one.

A manifest comes in two kinds, and each package's entry below says which kind it has. Both are asserted identically;
what differs is what the digests prove.

- **Upstream's own release manifest, vendored verbatim** — `atlas`. The digests prove both that nobody has edited the
  copy and that it IS the tagged release, because upstream published them. Such a manifest also lists files we never
  vendor (release artifacts, the dist-info), which is why the gate compares only the `<package>/` entries — and why it
  checks the manifest's dist-info licence entry against the sibling `<package>.LICENSE`.
- **Generated here from the tree as we ship it** — `vdf`. A copy carrying a deliberate local patch can never match an
  upstream release manifest, so its manifest is our own digest of the patched copy: it proves that nobody has reached
  into the tree since, and nothing about upstream identity. Only review catches a manifest regenerated to bless an edit,
  so regenerating one is the last step of a deliberate re-copy, version bump or patch — never the answer to a failing
  gate:

  ```sh
  cd py_modules/_vendor && find <package> -type f -not -path '*/__pycache__/*' \
      | LC_ALL=C sort | xargs sha256sum > <package>.SHA256SUMS
  ```

  `LC_ALL=C` is not decoration. The gate reads the manifest into a mapping and does not care about line order, but a
  locale-collated `sort` orders `vdf/__init__.py` against `vdf/LICENSE` differently on a German machine than under C, so
  without it every regeneration is a whole-file diff.

## atlas

The [emu-atlas](https://github.com/danielcopper/emu-atlas) resolver — the config-aware emulator-knowledge library
extracted from this plugin.

- **Upstream:** <https://github.com/danielcopper/emu-atlas>
- **Version:** 0.12.0 — tag `v0.12.0`, from the release's `emu_atlas-0.12.0-py3-none-any.whl`
  (`sha256:ddd5286e12d7c13f68b14aeef4ce35b1bfa83ec1aebbd797ae07c40b7ff04a3c`)
- **License:** MIT — see [`atlas.LICENSE`](atlas.LICENSE)
- **Local patches:** none. Upstream made the package relocatable in
  [emu-atlas#327](https://github.com/danielcopper/emu-atlas/issues/327) — no absolute self-imports, no `files("atlas")`
  — so a verbatim copy resolves under `_vendor.atlas` with nothing to change. That is the whole premise of the checksum
  pin: unlike `vdf` below, there is no patch to reapply, so an edit here is always wrong.

The licence sits **beside** the tree as `atlas.LICENSE`, not inside it, and upstream's own release manifest is vendored
verbatim as `atlas.SHA256SUMS`. That keeps `atlas/` exactly equal to the manifest's file set, which is what lets
`scripts/check_vendored_trees.py` assert set **equality** — nothing missing, nothing added — with no per-file
exceptions. The equality half is not optional: `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing` exits 0 after a vendored file is deleted,
so a plain checksum sweep would pass a half-copied tree.

`_vendor.atlas` is consumed by two adapters: `adapters/atlas_firmware.py` (the firmware seams behind
`services.protocols.FirmwareResolver` and `FirmwareFolderVerdictFn`) and `adapters/atlas_catalogue.py` (the emulator
catalogue behind `CoreInfoProvider`, `SystemSupportedExtensionsFn`, `SystemM3uSupportFn` and `SystemKnownFn`).
`tests/test_vendored_atlas.py` additionally imports it and asserts the pinned version, so the copy is proven to resolve
and not merely to hash correctly even if both adapters ever stop importing it. That test also imports the tree with
`xml.etree` blocked at `sys.meta_path`: Decky Loader's PyInstaller runtime does not ship that module, upstream answers
it with `atlas/_xml.py` (ElementTree's shape on expat directly), and nothing about a release states which parser it
reaches for — so a version bump that reintroduces `xml.etree` would import cleanly in CI and kill the backend at
bootstrap on a real Deck.

### How to update atlas

1. Download the wheel and the manifest from the newer tagged release:

   ```sh
   gh release download <tag> -R danielcopper/emu-atlas -p 'emu_atlas-*-py3-none-any.whl' -p SHA256SUMS -D /tmp/atlas
   ```

2. Verify the wheel against the manifest, then unpack it:

   ```sh
   cd /tmp/atlas && sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS && unzip -d u emu_atlas-*-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

3. Replace `py_modules/_vendor/atlas/` with `/tmp/atlas/u/atlas/`, leaving out any `__pycache__`. Copy
   `/tmp/atlas/u/emu_atlas-<version>.dist-info/licenses/LICENSE` to `py_modules/_vendor/atlas.LICENSE` and
   `/tmp/atlas/SHA256SUMS` to `py_modules/_vendor/atlas.SHA256SUMS`.
4. Bump the **Version** bullet above and the pinned version in `tests/test_vendored_atlas.py`.
5. Re-run the gate: `python scripts/check_vendored_trees.py`.

The gate runs in `mise run lint` and in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and the release smoke test asserts the tree
ships in the plugin zip, so both a tampered copy and a dropped one fail the pipeline.

## vdf

- **Upstream:** <https://github.com/ValvePython/vdf>
- **Version:** 3.4 — tag `v3.4`, commit `8104cb27c0b222bd802b69df58204ab389fc714c`
- **License:** MIT — see [`vdf/LICENSE`](vdf/LICENSE)
- **Local patches:** `vdf/__init__.py` — `from vdf.vdict import VDFDict` changed to `from .vdict import VDFDict`
  (relative self-import so the package resolves under `_vendor.vdf`, not a top-level `vdf`).
- **Manifest:** `vdf.SHA256SUMS`, **generated here** from the tree as we ship it — the patch above means no upstream
  manifest can ever match it. It pins the copy against later edits and says nothing about upstream identity; the
  provenance above is what ties it to `v3.4`.

The licence is vendored **inside** the tree as `vdf/LICENSE`, so the manifest covers it like any other file and there is
no sibling `vdf.LICENSE`. A generated manifest carries no dist-info licence entry, and the gate wants the two to agree
about each other: no entry and no sibling is the clean pair it expects here, and putting a `vdf.LICENSE` beside this
tree would be reported as pinned by nothing rather than quietly ignored.

That file is **not** upstream's own `vdf/LICENSE` — upstream's package directory holds `__init__.py` and `vdict.py` and
nothing else. It is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied inside the package so the redistributed tree carries its own
licence, and the update procedure below has to put it back by hand for exactly that reason.

### How to update vdf

1. Replace `py_modules/_vendor/vdf/` with the new upstream `vdf/`, leaving out any `__pycache__` — delete the old
   directory first rather than copying over it, since a file upstream has dropped would otherwise survive and step 4
   would regenerate the manifest from a tree holding it, pinning the leftover as if it belonged. This is the one
   procedure here with no upstream manifest to catch that. Then reapply the self-import patch above — dropping it makes
   the package resolve to a top-level `vdf` that is not installed.
2. Copy the upstream repository's **root** `LICENSE` back in as `py_modules/_vendor/vdf/LICENSE`. The previous step
   deletes it and upstream's `vdf/` does not carry one, so skipping this ships the package with no licence at all — and
   nothing would say so: step 4 regenerates the manifest from whatever tree is there, a generated manifest has no
   dist-info licence entry for the gate's licence assertion to run off, and there is no sibling `vdf.LICENSE` either, so
   the check stays green over a licence-less redistribution.
3. Bump the **Version** and **Local patches** bullets above.
4. Regenerate the manifest from the patched tree with the command under [Manifests](#manifests), then re-run the gate:
   `python scripts/check_vendored_trees.py`.

## The runtime a vendored copy has to load in

Decky Loader ships a **frozen Python** (a PyInstaller bundle), and nothing in this repo runs it — the venv,
`mise run test`, basedpyright and the linters are all ordinary CPython. A vendored package's assumptions about the
standard library, and about its own name, are therefore invisible here and surface at plugin load on a device. Both
shapes below are emu-atlas's own history and are fixed upstream in the release vendored today — but the first one is
this plugin's history too, it predates any vendoring at all, and the first atlas release vendored here still carried it.

- **A frozen build drops the stdlib wrapper and keeps the extension it wraps.** `xml.etree` is Python source over the
  expat extension, and PyInstaller bundles only the modules its analysis reached: on Decky's bundle
  `import xml.etree.ElementTree` raises `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xml.etree'` while expat itself sits in
  the bundle's `lib-dynload`. **This one bit the plugin's own code first.** Per-core BIOS filtering (#57, 2026-02-27)
  shipped `es_systems.xml` parsing on `xml.etree.ElementTree` and had to rewrite both of its readers onto expat's
  SAX-style callback API in the same change. That remedy is still load-bearing:
  [`adapters/es_find_rules.py`](../adapters/es_find_rules.py) parses `es_find_rules.xml` through `xml.parsers.expat` to
  this day and names the reason. Which readers carry it has shifted — #57's gamelist `<alternativeEmulator>` reader is
  retired, the find-rules reader arrived later (#1305) already written that way, and the `es_systems.xml` reader left
  with `adapters/es_de_config.py` (#1840): that file is the vendored resolver's to read now, which is why the same
  assumption below is the one that matters. It then arrived a second time, vendored: the copy landed at atlas 0.5.0
  (#1805), whose `installations.py` and `esde.py` imported `xml.etree` at module level, reachable straight from
  `atlas/__init__.py`. The wiring is where it surfaced — nothing in production imported `_vendor.atlas` until #1807, the
  change that both wired the resolver in and bumped past it, and on a device that import raised at `installations.py:28`
  and killed the backend at bootstrap ([emu-atlas#339](https://github.com/danielcopper/emu-atlas/issues/339), filed the
  day the copy landed). A device test found it; no gate here would have said a word. A checksum-pinned copy cannot be
  patched around a problem like that, so the assumption had to leave the library — upstream rebuilt the surface it uses
  directly on expat, importing `xml.parsers.expat` with a `pyexpat` fallback, and released that as 0.5.1 the same
  evening; #1807 vendored 0.6.0. The vendored [`atlas/_xml.py`](atlas/_xml.py) states the whole account, down to the
  namespace handling it deliberately does not reproduce; read it before reaching for `xml.etree` anywhere near a
  vendored tree.
- **A package named in a string rather than imported.** `importlib.resources.files("atlas")` addresses whatever package
  the host calls `atlas` — not this copy, which imports as `_vendor.atlas`. A string literal is invisible to an import
  rewrite and to every grep for import statements, which is what makes this shape cheap to miss. This one has not
  happened here: upstream anchored the read to the reading module's own `__package__` before the first copy landed, so
  the copy resolves under whatever parent it is given
  ([emu-atlas#327](https://github.com/danielcopper/emu-atlas/issues/327)); `atlas/_data.py` is the single place every
  packaged table is read through.

Neither artifact can see any of this, and each says less than it looks like it does. The checksum gate says the copy is
the bytes we pinned; it never imports anything. What says the copy imports is the test suite — most directly
[`tests/test_vendored_atlas.py`](../../tests/test_vendored_atlas.py), whose whole job that is, and alongside it every
test that reaches the firmware adapter — and all of it only under the venv's ordinary CPython. **Vendoring or bumping a
package is therefore a device test**, and what it guards against is a load-time failure — the plugin does not come up at
all, rather than one feature misbehaving, since `main.py` reaches the vendored resolver through a chain of module-level
imports. That matters most for what comes next: #1735 names `backports.zstd` as the next package expected here, vendored
so that Decky Loader's embedded Python 3.11 gains a zstd codec it does not ship. How that one behaves on a frozen
interpreter is not known yet — it is worth finding out on a device rather than inferring, which is the whole point of
the entries above.

## Formatters and vendored copies

`.githooks/pre-commit` formats **explicitly staged paths** — and an exclude written for a directory walk does not always
apply to a path handed over explicitly. That is how a formatter reaches a vendored copy:

- **Python — already handled, do not undo it.** `pyproject.toml` sets `force-exclude = true` under `[tool.ruff]`. That
  is what makes ruff honour `extend-exclude` for the explicit paths the hook passes; without it, `ruff format` on a
  staged vendored tree rewrites most of it and breaks byte-identity against the manifest. Changing `line-length` does
  not rescue it — upstream runs no Python formatter at all, so the line lengths measured all rewrite a large share of
  both trees; the measurement lives beside the setting it argues about, in the `[tool.ruff]` comment. Excluding the
  trees is the only answer. The checksum gate would catch it, but only after the commit — and removing that one line
  puts every future vendored package back in the same position, silently. It also stops the hook formatting and linting
  `./scripts`, which the same `extend-exclude` already asked for and CI already did; the hook was the last thing
  checking those files.
- **Markdown — still open, and nothing needs it yet.** `deno fmt` (`deno.json` includes `**/*.md`), `markdownlint-cli2`
  (the `lint:md` mise task) and `scripts/check_markdown_links.py` (which walks `git ls-files '*.md'`) all reach tracked
  markdown under `_vendor/`, and the hook reformats staged `.md` too. The emu-atlas wheel ships no markdown, so there is
  nothing to exclude today — but the next vendored package may, and reformatted prose breaks byte-identity exactly like
  reformatted code.

**The trap is not limited to vendored trees.** Any directory a _different_ formatter owns is exposed the same way, and
there it costs a whole tree rather than one file: the markdown formatter is configured for `**/*.md`, but handed `src/`
as an explicit path it reformats the TypeScript that prettier owns — 186 files in one command, every one a real diff,
and `pnpm format:check` is the only thing that notices. Hand a formatter the paths it owns, never a directory that
merely contains them.


## cpython_html

- **Upstream:** https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/v3.11.14/Lib/html
- **Version:** CPython `v3.11.14`, Python 3.11-compatible pure-Python sources.
- **Files:** `Lib/html/{__init__,parser,entities}.py`, `Lib/_markupbase.py`, and
  the repository's `LICENSE` (retained inside this package).
- **Local patches:** three import relocations only: `html.entities` to `.entities`,
  `import _markupbase` to `from . import _markupbase`, and `from html import unescape`
  to `from . import unescape`. Parser behavior is unchanged.
- **Manifest:** generated here from the relocated copy, including its license.

Decky v3.2.8's released PluginLoader contains `html` and `html.entities` but omits
`html.parser` and `_markupbase`. Bundle the parser's full pure-Python dependency
closure so neither its startup nor entity handling depends on these optional modules.
The only remaining external import is `re`, already required throughout Tender.
Use `_vendor.cpython_html.parser` directly; do not modify global `sys.modules`.

To update, download these five files from a reviewed CPython tag, apply only the
three import relocations above, then regenerate `cpython_html.SHA256SUMS` and run
the vendored-tree check and catalogue bootstrap/parser regression test. Original
`v3.11.14` SHA-256 hashes before relocation:
