"""Read-only module gate: a module whose name promises reads may not write.

A module named for reading is a promise about *when* it may be called. The
promise is worth something only while it holds: the sync's registry reads are
offloaded to an executor and opened as their own short Units of Work, chosen for
where they are cheap rather than for where a write would be safe. Drop a write
in among them and it commits at a moment nobody picked.

Each module listed in :data:`READ_ONLY_MODULES` is walked for repository calls —
``<anything>.<repo>.<method>(...)`` where ``<repo>`` is one of the eleven
repositories :class:`services.protocols.uow.UnitOfWork` exposes — and every
method that is not a read is a finding. Read or write is decided **by the name's
shape**: ``get`` / ``get_*`` / ``iter_*`` / ``count`` plus the explicit names in
:data:`READ_METHODS`. That partition is exact over
``services/protocols/repositories.py`` as it stands today (no write there matches
a read shape: ``save``, ``delete``, ``clear``, ``clear_*``, ``replace_all``,
``set``, ``set_*``), and `test_check_read_only_module.py` re-derives every method
name from that file so a new one has to be classified here rather than drift past.

**The two directions are not symmetric, and the asymmetry runs the wrong way.**
A read named outside the shapes is called a write: it fails loud until a line is
added below, which is safe. A **write named like a read is called a read and
passes in silence** — ``uow.roms.get_or_create(1)`` and
``uow.roms.iter_and_purge()`` are both green today. Nothing in the scan looks at
what a method does, so a repository that grows a read-shaped mutator reopens
exactly the accident this gate is otherwise for. That is a reason to keep naming
repository writes as writes, not a hole the gate can close.

It is a surface-syntax guardrail over one file each, not dataflow analysis. What
it cannot see:

* a write reached through a **helper** — the listed module calling a function
  elsewhere that writes; only calls written in the module itself are inspected;
* a write **passed as a bound method rather than called** —
  ``loop.run_in_executor(None, uow.roms.save, rom)`` is an ``ast.Attribute``, not
  an ``ast.Call``, so the scan never sees it. This one is pointed rather than
  theoretical: every method in the declared module is *invoked* through that
  exact idiom, so it is the shape a reader of this area reaches for;
* a **read-shaped write name**, per the asymmetry above;
* an **aliased repository handle** (``repo = uow.roms`` then ``repo.save(...)``),
  which flattens the two-attribute shape the scan matches on;
* ``getattr(uow, "roms").save(...)`` or any other dynamically-named access;
* a write through a repository the UoW does not expose under one of the eleven
  names in :data:`REPOSITORY_ATTRS`, including a future twelfth not added here.

What the gate does catch is the plain ``uow.roms.save(...)`` added to a read
module because it was the closest place with a Unit of Work already open. The
list above is the honest boundary of that: most of it is what a deliberate
evasion would look like, but the bound-method reference and the read-shaped name
are accidents too, and they pass.

Exit 0 when every listed module only reads, 1 (one line per offending call)
otherwise.
