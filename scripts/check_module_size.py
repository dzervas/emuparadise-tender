"""Hold the line on module size: no new god classes, no growth in the old ones.

CLAUDE.md sets a decomposition threshold for every first-party backend tree —
``services/``, ``bootstrap/``, ``adapters/``, ``domain/``, ``lib/`` and
``models/``. It lived in prose, and prose drifted: ``sync_orchestrator.py`` was
901 lines when #999 wrote it down and kept growing. Nothing failed in between,
because nothing was watching.

This gate watches. Every in-scope module above the threshold carries a ceiling
in ``ALLOWLIST`` — the size it had when it was recorded, movable only under the
narrow condition stated at that list. That buys the property the prose rule
never had:

* a **new** module cannot cross the threshold at all, because it is not listed;
* a **listed** module cannot grow past its ceiling, and that ceiling goes up
  only for a change that adds no code, with the reason recorded at its entry;
* a module that shrinks back under the threshold must leave the list, so an
  entry never becomes permanent.

Shrinking below the ceiling without reaching the threshold passes. Demanding an
exact match would fail CI on any refactor that nets a single line; the gate
prints an advisory instead, once the banked slack is worth writing down.

Ceilings are lines of code: blank and comment-only lines do not count, so
``grep -cvE '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' <file>`` reproduces them exactly. Comments must
not compete with code for the ceiling — counting them makes deleting an
explanation the cheapest way to afford a line of logic, and that trade is worst
in exactly the largest modules. Docstrings do count as code, deliberately:
exempting them would just move the prose one quote-mark over to dodge the
counter.

There is deliberately no ``--update`` flag: re-baselining is the one edit that
has to be a conscious, reviewable diff — never a command run to get back to
green.

#   ``main.py`` owns the Decky lifecycle plus one ``async def`` per callable,
#     so it grows with the callable surface by design (CLAUDE.md, "Process
#     boundaries").
#   ``py_modules/_vendor`` holds checksum-pinned upstream copies; their size
#     is upstream's decision (.claude/rules/vendored-assets.md).
#   ``tests/`` is one file per source module by rule
#     (.claude/rules/testing-backend.md), so a large test file is that rule
#     working — gating it here would put two of our own rules in conflict.
#   ``scripts/`` is developer tooling that never ships.
#   ``src/`` has the same god-class problem and no enforcement, but needs a
#     per-scope glob first: ``in_scope`` hardcodes ``*.py``.
