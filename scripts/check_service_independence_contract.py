"""Service-independence contract completeness check.

``.importlinter``'s ``service-independence`` contract is an ``independence``
contract over a hand-enumerated ``modules`` list. Hand-maintained lists rot: a
new service module is easy to add under ``py_modules/services/`` while forgetting
to enrol it, and a renamed or removed service leaves a stale entry behind. Either
way the flagship layer-boundary enforcement silently stops covering reality.

This check derives the expected service set from the filesystem and fails when
``.importlinter`` and the directory diverge — making the list self-healing.

Derivation rule (a "service" = one independence entry):

  * every ``py_modules/services/<name>.py`` except ``__init__.py`` -> ``services.<name>``
  * every ``py_modules/services/<dir>/`` package (has ``__init__.py``) except
    ``protocols/`` -> ``services.<dir>``

A sub-package (e.g. ``services.saves``, ``services.library``) counts as ONE entry,
not one-per-file: the sub-services inside a bounded context may import each other
concretely (the documented carve-out in CLAUDE.md); independence is enforced
between the top-level entries, so the contract lists the package, not its
internals. ``services.protocols`` is not a service — it is the Protocol namespace
services depend on — so it is excluded.

``EXEMPT`` holds services deliberately kept out of the contract. It is empty
today; an entry here is a conscious "this service is intentionally not subject to
the independence contract" decision — the alternative the failure message offers
to simply enrolling the service.

Exit 0 when the contract matches the filesystem, 1 (one line per discrepancy)
otherwise.
