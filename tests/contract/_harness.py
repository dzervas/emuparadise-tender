"""Contract-test harness — the real ``Plugin`` over the real ``bootstrap()``.

This tier drives the actual ``main.py`` callable surface the way the
frontend does. Anything that builds, wires, or seeds the real plugin for
a contract test belongs here; the per-callable contract assertions live
in the sibling ``test_*.py`` modules.

What stays real vs. what is faked
=================================

The harness calls the **real** :func:`bootstrap` (real settings dict,
real SQLite database + migrations, real file-store adapters) rooted under
a pytest ``tmp_path`` and wires the **real** services via the real
:func:`wire_services`. Only the outermost edges are swapped:

* ``romm_api`` → :class:`FakeRommApi` (the network transport — so tests
  seed library/saves/server state and inject failures without HTTP).
* ``sgdb_adapter`` → :class:`FakeSteamGridDbApi` (the SteamGridDB
  network transport).
* ``clock`` / ``uuid_gen`` / ``sleeper`` → the deterministic fakes from
  ``tests.fakes.system_time`` so timestamped responses are assertable.
* ``http_adapter.with_retry`` → a single-attempt pass-through so a
  failure-injection test does not pay the real exponential backoff
  ``time.sleep`` (1s, 3s …). Everything else on the real
  ``RommHttpAdapter`` (``resolve_system``, settings binding) stays real —
  it is a pure settings/file read with no network on the read paths.
* ``emit`` → an ``AsyncMock`` so tests assert emissions.

The SQLite database, the file stores, and the settings file all write
into ``tmp_path``; that is intended and isolated per test (pytest hands
each test a fresh ``tmp_path``).
