"""Contract test for migration 005 — un-confirming a legacy slot:null ROM (#1276).

Runs the real migration runner against the harness's real SQLite database. A
pre-#1276 ROM confirmed into the legacy no-slot mode (``active_slot=None,
slot_confirmed=1``) is seeded directly (``confirm_slot`` now rejects that shape),
the runner applies 005, and the row's confirmation is flipped back so the
first-sync wizard reappears — while the per-file baselines and the slots
read-model survive untouched (005 only flips ``slot_confirmed``, never deletes).
